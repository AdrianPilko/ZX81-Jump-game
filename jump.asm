;================== Room config design - may only be partially implemented
;; fixed length of 32 bytes per room

; Room Config. Every room will have a predefined layout using simple constructs
; They will follow this common layout:
; 1) room id number - 8 bits 0 to 255 - room zero is start
; 2) doors  - 3 doors - can be enabled and disabled
;        a) orientation - east=1 west=2 up=3 down=4
;        b) start position (relative to Display+1 (DF_CC))
;        c) 8bit end position count from start
;        d) id of the room to enter next when pass through door
; 3) 3 platforms per room can be set valid or not 
;        a) character to draw
;        b) 16bit start position (relative to Display+1 (DF_CC))
;        c) 8bit end position count from start
;         terminated with 255 (chosen as that is never a valid character)
;         so you can have as many as you like
;        d) list of enemies 
;           i) start position
;           ii) end position 
;           iii) speed
;           iv) sprite memory location
; 4) list of tokens to collect
; ================
;; Enemy config - list of enemy types - including memory location of the sprite

;; early implementation will not have all the features
